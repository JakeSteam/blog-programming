I recently needed a SQLite dictionary with word, type, and definition(s). Turns out, it was easy to make my own!

All code in this article is available in [WordNetToSQLite repo](https://github.com/jakesteam/wordnetToSQLite/), as is [the final `words.db`](https://github.com/JakeSteam/WordNetToSQLite/blob/main/words.db) database ([license](https://github.com/JakeSteam/WordNetToSQLite/blob/main/LICENSE)).

## Objective

For an upcoming word game app, I wanted a relatively small dictionary of words. I wanted to know the type of word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb), and any relevant definitions. I also wanted to only have sensible words (e.g. no proper nouns, or acronyms).

I decided to prefill a SQLite database and ship it with my app, since I can easily update it (just ship a new database, or even remotely update with SQL), easily browse it, and Android has good support for SQLite.

However, finding a suitable list of words was tricky! I found plenty containing just the words, or with no information on source or licensing. Luckily, [Princeton University's WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) exists, and is free to use!

However, it contains a lot of unneeded information and complexity, and is 33MB+ uncompressed. Time to filter it...

## Approach

- Description of data format
- Description of target outcome

## Results

### Sample data

Filtering `word` to `article`, alphabetical order:

| word          | type      | definitions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------ | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| antiparticle  | noun      | a particle that has the same mass as another particle but has opposite values for its other properties                                                                                                                                                       |
| article       | noun      | one of a class of artifacts#nonfictional prose forming an independent part of a publication#(grammar) a determiner that may indicate the specificity of reference of a noun phrase#a separate section of a legal document (as a statute or contract or will) |
| article       | verb      | bind by a contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| articled      | adjective | bound by contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| particle      | noun      | a function word that can be used in English to form phrasal verbs#a body having finite mass and internal structure but negligible dimensions#(nontechnical usage) a tiny piece of anything                                                                   |
| quasiparticle | noun      | a quantum of energy (in a crystal lattice or other system) that has position and momentum and can in some respects be regarded as a particle                                                                                                                 |

### Notes on contents

Word definitions for the same `type` are combined (e.g. with the noun `article`, but not the verb) with a `#` between definitions.

- `word`:
  - Any words with uppercase letters (e.g. proper nouns) are removed.
  - Any 1 character words are removed.
  - Any words with numbers are removed.
  - Any words with other characters (apostrophes, spaces) are removed.
  - Most profane words (133) are removed.
  - Roman numerals are removed (e.g. `XVII`).
- `type`:
  - Always `adjective` / `adverb` / `noun` / `verb`.
- `definition`:
  - Definition of the word, will contain multiple separated by `#` if the word appears as a synonym for another word.
  - Most profane definitions (385) are replaced with empty space.
  - May contain bracketed usage information, e.g. `(dated)`.
  - May contain special characters like `'`, `$`, `!`, `<`, `[`, etc.

Profanity removal (90% of the processing time) is performed using [better_profanity 0.6.1](https://github.com/snguyenthanh/better_profanity) (with a whitelist for the word "horny", only used in a lizard context). This isn't perfect for biological words, but works quite well on the higher priority slurs. A full list of removed words and definitions is available in [removed-data.txt](/notes/removed-data.txt).

## Creating your own

If you wish to recreate `words.db` from scratch, you can:

1. Download `WNdb-3.0.tar.gz` from [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version).
2. Extract it, and place the `data.x` files in `/wordnet-data/`.
3. Run `py wordnet-to-sqlite.py`.

The raw data looks like this ("unknown" is the only valid noun to extract):

```
08632096 15 n 03 unknown 0 unknown_region 0 terra_incognita 0 001 @ 08630985 n 0000 | an unknown and unexplored region; "they came like angels out the unknown"
```

This script takes 10-15 seconds on an average laptop. Efficiency is not a priority (with profanity removal taking the majority of the time), as the output database only needs generating once ever.

Notes on WordNet's data files [are here](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/wndb5wn), this repo just does a "dumb" parse then filters out numerical data.
