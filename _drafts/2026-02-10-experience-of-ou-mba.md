At the end of 2025, I received my MBA after 4 years of part-time fully remote study. Here's a review of the entire process!

Before diving in, it's important to note that this is only _my experience_, and totally dependant on the course I completed, the specific modules I chose, and even the tutors and students I studied with. Additionally, I suspect a part-time Masters-level course is a very, very different experience to a full-time Bachelors-level course.

## Overall

Starting in 2021, I began studying for an [MBA in Technology Management (F69)](https://msds.open.ac.uk/students/study/postgraduate/qualification/f69.htm), essentially a combination of a typical MBA and more technical modules. The first year or so's modules were shared with all MBA students, with later modules having a more technical focus or picked from a shortlist of options.

The course's contents changes over time, with the specific modules I studied being:

- (2021) B870: Managing in a changing world
- (2021) B872: Creating and sustaining value
- (2022) TB801: Technology and innovation management
- (2023) T849: Strategic capabilities for technological innovation
- (2024) B874: Finance for strategic decision-making
- (2024) BB851: Entrepreneurship in context
- (2024) BXR873: Technology Management MBA residential school
- (2025) B875: Leaders of change (MBA project)

I won't review each module individually, since my knowledge is likely outdated, but will mention specific examples where relevant.

## Flexibility

### Long term flexibility

At Open University, you study (and pay) on a module by module basis with modules typically starting every 6 months. This allows flexibility, for example I took a 1-year break when I moved job & house, with no specific action required besides not registering for the next module.

This was very convenient, allowing studying to fit around, y'know, everything else in my life. It did however mean losing touch with the few people I'd met on earlier modules, although this was far less of a concern than at a regular in-person university (see ["Social"](#social)).

### Day to day flexibility

You choose when you study. The Open University, at least at MBA level, assumes everyone has a job and family life they are also handling, prioritising flexibility wherever possible. This means, for example, all tutorials are recorded in case you can't make the time, and for most of my study I exclusively watched these recordings.

Similarly, whilst the amount of TMAs (Tutor Marked Assignments) vary between module, there are typically 2-3 with one due every couple of months. All the necessary information on these plus the course's entire contents is available from the very first day of the course, meaning you could technically complete the entire course the day it opens!

Of course, tutors share helpful tips closer to TMA times (usually in tutorials) so completing them too early is not a great idea, but in general this flexibility really allows you to learn in your preferred style.

For me personally, whilst a course's content will be organised into a certain number of hours of content / activities per week, this is just a guideline. As a fan of the flow state, I instead would typically do no Open University work for multiple weeks, then spend an occasional entire weekend completing around a month's worth of work at once! More on this in ["Workload"](#workload).

### Mature students

The MBA requires (with some exceptions) a Bachelors degree and at least 3 years in a managerial, technical, or professional role[^entry-requirements]. This means everyone you are studying with almost certainly be at least 25, and have had a few years of experience in an office-based role, and all the interpersonal skills this requires!

I was 29 when I began my studies, and typically the youngest person in any group session or tutorial with around 40 being my guess at an average. As with the workplace though, age is less important than everyone's shared interest in a single goal (learning) and willingness to get along.

Whilst there is far less of a social aspect than a typical Bachelors (see ["Social"](#social)), every interaction I had was _fine to positive_, with everyone's shared ambitiousness and willingness to learn proving a drastic difference. Of course, this is an MBA, so expect personalities more like your manager & manager's manager than an intern!

### Social

With all students typically have a job and family life outside the university, and spread around the globe, the social connections are far weaker than if you were studying an in-person course. However, as a running theme, you'll get as much social interaction as you want.

Despite being an introvert who prefers learning and working alone (typical software engineer, sorry!), I found engaging with any social initiatives to be generally beneficial. This consisted of a shared WhatsApp group for my first couple of modules, where the students were mostly the same, where people shared updates on deadlines, course material, and even had virtual coffee & study sessions.

This group, whilst a great initiative, ultimately died out as students went on different learning routes, took breaks, or the initial flurry of excitement wore off. Besides this, and plenty of new LinkedIn connections, there was essentially no social aspect to Open University for me.

## Workload

### Types of activity

The quantity and type of work will vary significantly between modules. Earlier modules contain lots of group forum discussions and quizzes throughout the learning, presumably to help new students feel invested in their learning process.
