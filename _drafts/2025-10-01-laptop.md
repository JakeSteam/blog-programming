Obviously all of these are benchmarks, so aren't _necessarily_ reflective of actual improvements. Regardless, the numbers are impressive, and reflect 4 years of technological progress.

- SSD: The SSD improvement across reads and writes is startling, as I didn't know PCIe 3.0 -> PCIe 4.0 would make such a difference! I was mainly just looking forward to 1TB, since 500GB was getting a little cramped. Sequential writes apparently benefited most from the upgrade, with an absurd +1820%!
