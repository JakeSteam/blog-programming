## Summary

- [Known Zendesk issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zendesk/comments/1o6u1ws/receiving_bunch_of_unsolicited_support_tickets/).
- Overall goal is presumably to send phishing emails and get a copy of the email sent to my inbox. This feature is disabled on most helpdesks.
- There seems to be multiple waves:
  - 18th January with capitalised prefixes was standard phishing (likely using [the Discord breach](https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service))
  - 4th Febuary seems personalised and intended to annoy more than phish? Regardless, none have actually worked.
